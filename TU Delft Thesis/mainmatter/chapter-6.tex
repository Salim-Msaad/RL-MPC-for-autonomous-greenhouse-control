\section{Initial RL and MPC Performance}
\emph{The initial performances of the respective MPC and RL performances}

\section{Case Study 1 - Value Function addition}
\emph{Results of including the vf from the trained agent, a self-trained vf and initial guesses from actor, and then finally a reduced order self-trained vf}

\section{Case Study 2 - Terminal Constraint}
\emph{Results and discussion of using a terminal constraint from the actor as well as allowing a slight deviation from the terminal constraint}

\section{Case Study 3 - Value Function and Terminal Constraint}
\emph{The Results and discussion of combining the two}


\section{Final Result and Conclusion}
\emph{The final selected algorithm and conlusion on the work done}

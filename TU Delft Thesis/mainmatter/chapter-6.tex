\chapter{Stochastic RL-MPC}
\label{chapter:stochastic_RL_MPC}
This chapter outlines the performance gains of the RL-MPC implementations selected from \autoref{chapter:deterministic_RL_MPC} in a stochastic environment. The initial performances of the standalone RL agents and MPC in various levels of uncertainty will be investigated, followed by comparisons with the RL-MPC implementations. This chapter seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-MPC controllers in a realistic setting, providing insight into the controllerâ€™s potential performance in real-world applications.

\section{Initial RL and MPC Performance}
The uncertainty present in the environment, as mentioned in \autoref{section:experimental-setup}, is characterised as parametric uncertainty. This parametric uncertainty not only attempts to capture model mismatch but also output noise. Consequently, it is customary to use a state estimator for MPC to mitigate this noise. A common and effective approach for MPC is to use the moving horizon estimation (MHE) technique, which can be naturally integrated into the MPC framework. Although it is effective, this thesis does not incorporate such an estimator, as the focus is on observing the impact of combining RL with MPC in a stochastic environment. Additionally, it is also important to note that a new agent was trained for each level of uncertainty (see \autoref{section:rl-stochastic-results}). Unless specified otherwise, it can be assumed that the corresponding agent is used for each uncertainty level in the RL and RL-MPC controllers. Performance metrics include the mean and variance of the final cumulative reward achieved (averaged across 30 simulations). The computational time required to calculate a control action is not considered, as the presence of uncertainty does not affect it.

\autoref{fig:stochastic-rl-vs-mpc} demonstrates the performance of RL and MPC for each prediction horizon and uncertainty level. Contrary to the nominal case shown in \ref{fig:rl-vs-mpc-nominal}, RL consistently outperforms MPC for all prediction horizons and demonstrates superior performance, particularly when faced with higher levels of uncertainty. The variance obtained by RL is significantly lower than MPC, indicating even greater robustness. While it is not surprising given that RL was trained on stochastic data, the findings from \autoref{fig:stochastic-rl-vs-mpc} indicate that as uncertainty levels increase, the effect of increasing the prediction horizon on performance improvement diminishes and may even hinder the performance of MPC in extreme cases of uncertainty. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, while MPC and RL demonstrate comparable performance under conditions of low uncertainty, the final cumulative reward of MPC exhibits significantly higher variance than RL. It is investigated whether this robustness to uncertainty is also applied to the RL-MPC controllers.\\
As stated in \autoref{section:final-rl-mpc-nominal}, RL-MPC 3 (which includes a terminal region constraint) and RL-MPC 5 (which includes a terminal region constraint and a value function as a terminal cost function) are evaluated at different levels of uncertainty. The performance of these implementations is then compared to that of the standalone RL and MPC controllers. The reference trajectory is generated by the RL agent and is based on deterministic predictions.

\end{figure}

The performance comparison between RL-MPC 3 and RL-MPC 5 in a stochastic environment, and their comparison with standalone RL and MPC controllers, is shown in \autoref{fig:stochastic-mpv-vs-rl-rlmpc3-vs-rlmpc5}. Similarly to the nominal case, it is evident that when uncertainty is low ($\delta = 5\%$), the RL-MPC controllers outperform RL and MPC in terms of the mean final cumulative reward. However, it appears that the variance of the resulting RL-MPC controllers is greater than RL, but lower than MPC. It appears as if the variance is averaged between the two controllers. 
However, the behaviour of the RL-MPC controllers becomes intriguing when faced with higher levels of uncertainty. It seems that when there is a high degree of uncertainty, the performance of the RL-MPC controller is significantly impacted due to the poor performance of MPC in such highly stochastic environments. The same can be seen for the variance. While the performance of RL-MPC in a stochastic environment with a $\delta = 10\%$  is comparable to that of RL, it is evident that increasing the prediction horizon affects performance significantly, since it brings the RL-MPC's performance closer to MPC. For an uncertainty level of $\delta = 20\%$ the RL-MPC performance is drastically impacted by an increase in prediction horizon; however, it still outperforms MPC. A general trend is that, as the prediction horizon increases, the RL-MPC controller becomes more similar to the MPC controller. Conversely, with shorter prediction horizons, it becomes more similar to the RL policy. Due to the performance superiority of RL, for higher levels of uncertainty, it might be desirable to keep the RL-MPC prediction horizon as short as possible to achieve higher performance in terms of the mean and variance of the final cumulative reward. Furthermore, it is clear that including a value function as a terminal cost function, in conjunction with a terminal region, has improved performance when compared to using only a terminal region (RL-MPC 3 vs RL-MPC 5). This behaviour is similar to that observed in the nominal case.

In practice, the exact uncertainty of a model is not known; thus, a conservative estimate of uncertainty is assumed during the development of a controller. A parametric uncertainty of $\delta = 20\%$ may be considered too conservative. If the model and environment are well known, it could have a detrimental effect on the performance of designing a controller on such a high level of uncertainty, and similarly for when developing a controller assuming a low parametric uncertainty. Therefore, depending on the confidence in the accuracy of the environment model, a reasonable level of uncertainty is typically assumed when developing the controller to ensure that it can still perform well under different conditions. This approach helps in creating robust controllers that can handle variations and uncertainties in the real world, leading to better performance and stability in practical applications. Thus, it was determined to examine the effectiveness of the RL-MPC controller when designed with an uncertainty level of $\delta = 10\%$ and evaluated under different uncertainty levels. This evaluation was compared to an RL agent also trained with an uncertainty level of $\delta = 10\%$ and the nominal MPC. Moreover, it can be seen in \autoref{fig:stochastic-mpv-vs-rl-rlmpc3-vs-rlmpc5} that careful consideration must be taken when selecting a prediction horizon for RL-MPC and MPC since a longer prediction horizon might not have the desired affect on performance due to the accumulation of uncertainty across the prediction horizon. Thus, a prediction horizon of 3 hours was chosen for MPC and RL-MPC 5 (since this is the best performing RL-MPC controller), which was considered a suitable compromise for this study.

\end{figure}

The performance of the RL-MPC controller under various levels of parametric uncertainty is shown in \autoref{fig:stochastic-reallife}. The superiority of the RL-MPC controller over the MPC and RL controllers under normal conditions is again demonstrated in \autoref{fig:stochastic-reallife} in terms of mean final cumulative reward. This trend persists until uncertainty reaches a threshold where MPC's performance noticeably declines, which negatively affects the RL-MPC's performance. Despite this, RL-MPC consistently outperforms MPC, showing a less severe performance drop as uncertainty increases. Similarly, the variance achieved of the RL-MPC is consistently between RL and MPC. The RL agent remains the best performer under high uncertainty. \autoref{fig:stochastic-reallife} suggests that equipping an MPC with terminal constraints and a cost function generated by an RL agent trained on stochastic data enhances the MPC's understanding and management of system uncertainty. Essentially, this approach makes the MPC more robust against noise without sacrificing performance at lower uncertainty levels, and even enhances it. It is mentioned again that no state estimator is employed in the MPC's framework. By implementing this approach, the performance of the MPC is likely to enhance significantly under conditions of high uncertainty. As a result, the performance of the RL-MPC is also expected to improve and could potentially rival RL even at high levels of uncertainty. Moreover, if a stochastic MPC was used, such as in \citet{boersmaRobustSamplebasedModel2022}, the performance of both MPC and RL-MPC controllers could be even greater. 


\section{Conclusion}
This chapter has demonstrated the performance gains of the RL-MPC controller in a stochastic environment, which builds on the deterministic evaluations performed in \autoref{chapter:deterministic_RL_MPC}. These results highlight the effectiveness of the RL-MPC controller and its robustness in varying levels of uncertainties as compared to MPC. \\
The initial experiments compared standalone RL agents (trained on stochastic data) and an MPC controller. The results consistently showed that RL outperformed MPC in terms of performance across all prediction horizons and uncertainty levels, except for cases with very low uncertainty and a long prediction horizon. Furthermore, RLâ€™s capacity to manage uncertainty was further demonstrated by the significantly reduced variance in the final cumulative reward compared to MPC. This level of robustness is essential for practical applications in which uncertainty is a common problem.\\
Further analysis evaluated RL-MPC controllers under different uncertainty levels, specifically RL-MPC 3 and RL-MPC 5. The findings indicate that RL-MPC consistently outperforms the MPC and the RL controllers when uncertainty is low. However, as uncertainty increases, the performance of RL-MPC approaches MPC, especially with longer prediction horizons, resulting in inferior performance compared to RL. This trend suggests that shorter prediction horizons are preferable for maintaining the superior performance of RL policies in the RL-MPC framework. Moreover, incorporating a value function as a terminal cost function, as in RL-MPC 5, consistently enhances performance over using only a terminal region. Therefore, adding the value function as a cost function sees benefits in deterministic and stochastic settings.

In real-world scenarios, exact uncertainty levels are often unknown, necessitating conservative estimates during controller development. The performed study with a conservative uncertainty level of $\delta = 10\%$ shows that the RL-MPC controller, with a prediction horizon of 3 hours, can effectively manage varying uncertainty levels, outperforming RL and MPC at low uncertainty levels with a more gradual drop in performance at higher uncertainty levels compared to MPC, indicating that the RL-MPC controller has a higher level of robustness. The MPC framework may be adapted to accommodate uncertainty, specifically a state estimator for output uncertainty and a sample-based approach for model parametric uncertainty. By implementing this approach, the performance and robustness of the MPC can be expected to improve in a stochastic environment. Furthermore, even greater performance and robustness improvements can be anticipated if these methodologies are applied to the RL-MPC framework.

In conclusion, this chapter demonstrated that the RL-MPC controller is highly efficient, even in a stochastic environment. While RL still performs better than the RL-MPC controller under extreme levels of uncertainty, significant performance enhancements can be achieved at low uncertainty levels while being more robust than MPC at high uncertainties.

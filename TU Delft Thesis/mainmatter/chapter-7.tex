\emph{description of chapter}

\section{Case Study 1 - Reducing Neurons}
\emph{the results and discussion of the effect of reducing the neurons in the value funciton and the effect on computational time and performance}

\section{Case Study 2 - Taylor Approximation}
\emph{results and disucssion of using order 1 and 2 of a taylor approximation of the value function}

\section{Case Study 3 - Reduced Order vs Full Order Value Function}
\emph{The effect of a reduced value function and full value function, this might not be necessary}

\section{Final Result and Conclusion}

\emph{A conclusion of the chapter outlining the work done}

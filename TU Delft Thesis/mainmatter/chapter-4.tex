\chapter{Model Predictive Control Setup}
\label{chapter:MPC}


\section{Greenhouse MPC problem formulation}
\emph{Includes the MPC problem formulation of the greenhouse \\ Explains the importance of keeping the OCP as similar to the RL for accurate comparison}

\section{Deterministic Results}
\emph{The results and discussion of the deterministic case with different prediction horizons. Show the affect on temperature and c02 with longer time horizons and maybe include the affect of giving the mpc initial guesses (the previous time step results).}

\section{Stochastic Results}
\emph{The results and discussion of the stochastic case with different prediction horizons, similar to that of the deterministic case}


\section{Conclusion}
\emph{A brief conclusion of the work done and what will be carried over to the RL-MPC framework}
